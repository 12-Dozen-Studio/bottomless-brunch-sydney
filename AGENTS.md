# Agent Guidelines

This repository aims to get the Bottomless Brunch Sydney web app ready for release. Agents assist with any task that helps refine the app, including:

- Fast prototyping and copywriting
- Data corrections and spot-checks
- UI/UX feedback
- Code reviews and polish

## Code Style
- Use two spaces for indentation.
- In HTML use double quotes; in JavaScript use single quotes and terminate statements with semicolons.
- Keep lines under 120 characters.

## Commit Messages
- Start with a short imperative summary (max 50 characters).
- Provide additional context in the body if needed.

## Testing
- No automated test suite exists yet.
- Run `node --check assets/script.js` before committing to ensure JavaScript syntax validity.
